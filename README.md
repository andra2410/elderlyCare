Designed and developed an Elderly Care Platform using Flask, facilitating connections between caregivers and careseekers.
One of the key objectives in developing this platform was to create an intuitive and user-friendly experience for all stakeholders involved. 
Caregivers are empowered to create detailed profiles showcasing their skills, experience, and availability, while careseekers can search and filter through these profiles to find caregivers that best match their specific requirements and preferences.
